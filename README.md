Implementation of linear SVM classification models

The algorithms implemented are:

Perceptron,

Avg Perceptron,

Pegasos,

The main.py method loads the relavent data and then trains each of the models. Finally we compare the accuracy of the models and then test the best model to classify movie reviews and output the top words that indicate a positive review.
